# Recommendation with IBM

This project is part an important collaboration with IBM, the provider of the 
dataset. The aim is to develop a recommendation engine and suggest new articles
 to the 
 [IBM Watson Community](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/community?context=wdp)
users.

The notebook in the repo contains all the necessary info on the engine.
Including its working, implementation, pros and cons and some info on how it
can be improved.
